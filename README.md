# GestureRecognition
A simple model to detect when an open hand is open in-front of the camera

This project was proposed as a proof of concept for interacting with a computer in a non-tactile way. 
The program uses a laptop webcam to determine if the person using the laptop has their fist opened or
closed. This is then displayed on the screen. 

The repository also contains the necessary files for training the model which can be done on a per-user
basis. Camera.py can be used for data collection and Gesture.py to train the model. Run.py will execute
the trained model on live data.
